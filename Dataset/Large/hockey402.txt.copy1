Yeah, the Nords look like they're going to be good...but (excuse the
bias) have you ever watched the Pens on a rush?...Don't answer: everyone
has seen this footage.  Near the end of the season when the Pens played
the Nords it was like watching a (younger) double of the Pens.  ...The
Nords looked good right up to the point when they lost.
