   Boy - everyone has been ripping on ESPN's hockey coverage (or is it just
Pittsburgher's who are thrilled with Lange & Steigy?)  For all of you
who are unaware -> ESPN bought the air time from ABC and did all the 
production, advertising sales, commentating, etc -> and even 
reaped any $ made...

Enjoy,
Caleb
