When you think of the NHL, who comes to mind? Gilmour? Gretzky? Mario?
.. ah... did I mention Mario? If you said Gretzky, you haven't really
been following along, have you. If you said Gilmour, you are a true
Maynard. 

I don't even think the selection of the HArt deserves serious discussion on
this group. It is a no-brainer.
