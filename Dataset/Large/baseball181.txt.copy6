Going into the ninth with a 3 run lead, ...2 runs score...runners on 
first and second...RD throws, "there's a drive waaaaaayyyyyyy back, 
Puckett to the wall, leaps, He CAUGHT THE BALL!!!!  WHAT A CATCH BY KIRBY!!
TWINS WIN!"  and RD gets the save.  His line 1 IP, 2 walks, 2 hits, and
one robbed home run...
