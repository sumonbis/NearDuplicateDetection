Root for another team. ;-)

: Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against 
: the Wings.  They are too small.  The key to any Leafs success
: will have to be Clark.  He is the only centre who can have
..
Andreychuk, is NOT small, slow and sloth-like, maybe, but he is
about 6'4" and that is not what I would consider as small.

As an aside, The big AndreyCHUNK as I call him has been known to
disappear come playoff time.  This was one of his main problems when
playing for Buffalo.

: GO LEAFS !!!
GO SABRES !!!
