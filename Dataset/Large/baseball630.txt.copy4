Gaetti, Gary         .616  .638  .655  .632  ----   0.637

Apologies if I don't know what I'm talking about :-), but as a Twins fan,
I like to think they have good players in any park.  Not sure if I remember
completely or not, but I think Gaetti played with the Twins in '87 for the 
world series, and again in '88 (note that's his lowest of the 4).  I believe 
the next 3 (or at least the last two) were played with the Angels.   Lots
of factors make a player excell...  I hate it when so many use the dome.
It may not be ideal, but nice to comfortably enjoy baseball and football 
even when it's snowing and raining.

I'm sure the company for which I work does not have all the same opinions 
that I do...
